# Ib-Scraping-the-Premier-League

# Introduction
This project is aimed at scraping data from the Premier League website using the Scrapy framework. The goal was to extract match details for all the matches played in the Premier League for the last five years. The data scraped includes the date, season, referee name, stadium name, Home Team Name, Home Team Score, Away Team Name, and Away Team Score. Additionally, we scraped details for both the home and away teams including possession %, shots on target, shots, touches, passes, tackles, clearances, corners, offsides, yellow cards and fouls conceded.

# Data
The scraped data is stored in a CSV file with separate columns for each field. The CSV file contains over 20,000 records, covering all the matches played in the Premier League for the last five years.

# Implementation
I implemented the web scraping process using the Scrapy framework. I created a spider to crawl the website and extract the required data. The spider uses XPath selectors to locate and extract data from the HTML content of the website.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the use of Scrapy framework for web scraping and extracting data from a large website. The scraped data can be used for further analysis to gain insights into the performance of teams and players in the Premier League.
